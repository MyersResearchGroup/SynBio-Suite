### Toggle Switch

The toggle switch is a state holding gate and consists of two promoters each followed by a coding sequence. Each promoter is repressed by the protein transcribed by the other promoter [2].

When opening [SynBioSuite](https://synbiosuite.org/) in Google Chrome click the blue __Open Folder__ button located in the top left corner. Select this folder, _Example 2_, and allow the site to edit its files. You will then see the GeneticToggleSwitch under the SBML Files menu and the Analysis under the Analysis menu.

When opening the Analysis with a double click you can click the __Run Analysis__ button to start the simulation. After the simulation is finished you will see a blue 1 next to the _RESULTS_ tab in the top left corner. After selecting the _RESULTS_ tab, select _IPTG_, _aTc_, and _YFP_ to be displayed to see the toggle switch's behavior:
