### Examples

This directory includes four examples for each possible use case of [SynBioSuite](https://synbiosuite.org/). To go through the examples download the examples and open them in SynBioSuite. When moving from one example to another, refresh the browser and SynBioSuite allows you to open a new project.

1. The first use case is the simulation of a SBOL file shown in example 1 using the _repressilator_ as an example

2. The second use case is the simulation of a SBML file shown in example 2 using the _genetic toggle switch_ as an example

3. The third use case is the simulation of a SBML file using an OMEX archive shown in example 3 using a simple _inverter_ as an example

4. The fourth use case is the simulation of an OMEX archive shown in example 4 using again the _genetic toggle switch_

More information about each example can be found in the corresponding directory.
